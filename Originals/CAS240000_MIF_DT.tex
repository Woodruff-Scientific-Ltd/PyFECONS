\subsection{Cost Category 24: Electric Plant Equipment}
Consists of the switchgear, station service eqiupment, switchboards, protective equipment, electrical structures and 
wiring containers, power and control wiring and electrical lighting.  Accounts 21 through 23 all have interfaces with the power plant electrical service system and its associated equipment. This equipment is located both inside
and outside the main reactor/BOP buildings.

\begin{itemize}

\item Acct 24.1 Switchgear: Includes switchgear for the generator and station service, generator
transformer, auxiliary transformer, and connecting bus (typically to 10kV).

\item  Acct 24.2 Station Service Equipment: Includes substations, auxiliary power sources, load
centers, motor control centers, and station service and startup equipment,
transformers, and bus ducts (typically to 500V).

\item  Acct 24.3 Switchboards: Includes control panels, auxiliary power and signal boards,
batteries, DC equipment, and non-interruptible power.

\item  Acct 24.4 Protective Systems Equipment: Includes grounding systems, lightning
protection, cathodic protection, heat tracing, freeze protection equipment,
radiation monitoring, environmental monitoring equipment, raceway, cable, and
connections. Excludes communication systems and building
services such as lighting, HVAC, and fire protection (which are included in their
respective building accounts).

\item  Acct 24.5 Electrical Raceway Systems: Includes cable tray, exposed conduits, embedded
conduits, underground conduit and duct systems, and the fittings, supports,
covers, boxes, access holes, ducts, and accessories for the scheduled cable
systems. Excludes raceways for protective systems (Account 24.4) and building
services electrical systems (which are included in their respective building
accounts).

\item  Acct 24.6 Power and Control Cables and Wiring: Typically includes all scheduled cable
systems and their associated fittings such as cable, straps, attachments,
terminations, wire lugs, cable numbers, and wire numbers. Excludes lighting,
communication, and other protection systems.

Cost basis is the NETL baseline Case B12A, Cost Category 11: Accessory Electric Plant Bare erected cost excluding engineering, construction mgmt, and
contingency \$37 million in source table for Coal Plant / 686 MW electric capacity in source table = \$54/kW applied to gross 
thermal power, to give a total of C240000 M USD.
