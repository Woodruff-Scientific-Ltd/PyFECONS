\subsubsection*{Cost Category 22.1.5:  Primary Structure and Support}
\label{sec:22.1.5}
This account defines the cost of the primary structure and support for the power core. This subsystem  transfers the gravity and seismic loads to the building support structures. Elements include reactor pressure vessel supports, brackets, sealings, pipe supports or others, including shielding materials if they are integral parts of the support structure. \\

For the reactor core itself, ARIES has a single cost algorithm for the entire primary structure and support. The  algorithm is \$0.200 M (\$0.440 M in 2023 USD) x the  volume of the primary structure (outside dimensions) in m3 (in \$1992\$ for a structure typical of  an LSA=4 power core). By applying this to the calculated structural volume from the radial build of structure volume m$^{3}$, the associated cost is C220105 M USD.
