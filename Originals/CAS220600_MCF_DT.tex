\subsubsection{Cost Category 22.6: Other Reactor Plant Equipment}
Consists of: all other power core equipment not specifically identified elsewhere: 22.6.1 Maintenance equipment (22.6.1.1 blanket maintenance equipment; 22.6.1.2 components rotated into service to
allow maintenance; 22.6.1.3 other; 22.6.2 special heating systems (start-up, etc); 22.6.3 coolant receiving, storage and make-up systems; 22.6.4 gas systems; 22.6.5 building vacuum systems.  Total budget is C220600 M USD.\\

By surveying the catalog of ARIES, Starfire, EBTR and Prom-L systems, a top-down algorithm can be determined. This is simply $11.5$ M USD $\times (P_E/1000)^{0.8}$. Due to the broad nature of this cost category,bottom-up calculations are difficult to perform, without precise details and engineering designs. For costing purposes, this algorithm is sufficient.
