\subsection{Cost Category 70: Annualized O\&M Cost (AOC)}

The Operations and Maintenance (O\&M) costs was previously estimated to be 2 \% of the direct cost, assessed annually.  The O\&M cost depends on the system complexity and the requirements of regulations, security and maintenance. The costs are computed based on look-up tables, such as the one shown in Fig. \ref{fig:statista} at 60 USD per kilowatt-year.

\begin{verbatim} 
C_OM = 60 * PE * 1000 = C700000  
\end{verbatim} 

Annualized O\&M costs are \$ C700000 M.

\subsubsection*{Cost Category 71 – O\&M Staff}

\subsubsection*{Cost Category 72 – Management Staff}
This Cost Category includes salary costs of operations management staff.

\subsubsection*{Cost Category 73 – Salary-Related Costs}

Cost of any operational spare parts, excluding capital plant upgrades or major equipment that will be capitalized or amortized over some period or quantity of product.\\

Annual Scheduled Replacement Cost. The cost of scheduled component replacement is now included in the annual operations and maintenance charge.  Here we assume that the components in the first wall and the blanket are replaced every 10 years, giving an annual replacement cost of \$ C750000 M.


\subsubsection*{Cost Category 76 – Utilities, Supplies, and Consumables}
Cost of water, gas, electricity, tools, machinery, maintenance equipment, office supplies and similar items purchased annually.
