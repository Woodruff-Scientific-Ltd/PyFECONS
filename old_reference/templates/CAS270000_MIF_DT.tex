\subsection{Cost Category 27: Special Materials}

This account contains the costs of specific types of materials that are introduced into the fusion power plant in the immediate prelude to the initiation of 
testing and validation procedures. These materials are characterized within conventional categories, encompassing coolants, cover gases 
designed for material handling systems and architectural components, breathable air containing specific compositions, as well as distinctive 
gases or liquids that have not been preloaded into the existing plant systems. It is essential to classify these materials as intrinsic components of the 
capital equipment, distinct from the diverse plant systems, and therefore not subject to acquisition via construction loans. The replenishment process for 
these materials is to be delineated as an operational expense. Among the specialized materials encompassed are eutectic salts, treated water, liquid metals, 
cryogenic liquids, gases with unique properties, and potentially select solid materials. \\

Costs are based on volumes. For a primary coolant of primaryC with a volume of 1000 cubic meters, a cost of \$ C270000 M is obtained.
